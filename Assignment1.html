            You have been working with the following original images, shot by you:
            <ul>
                <li>Coffee</li>
                <li>Tea</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
              
            <li> 1. A photo featuring an individual person.</li>
            
            <li>2. A photo featuring a group of people.</li>
            
            <li>3. A photo featuring a location.</li>
            
            <li> 4. A close-up photo of something.</li>
            
            <li> 5. A photo where something is too light/washed out/overexposed.</li>
            
            <li> 6. A photo where something is too dark/murky/underexposed.</li>
            
            Your assignment is as follows:
            
            <li> 1) Improve the lighting and legibility of the washed out/overexposed image.</li>
            
            <li> 2) Improve the lighting and legibility of the murky/underexposed image.</li>
            
            <li> 3) Crop the portrait, the close-up, and the location to squares and make a banner featuring all three side-by-side at equal size, with a pleasing amount of whitespace in between them.</li>
            
            <li> 4) Crop the picture of the group to 16:9 ratio.</li>
            
            <li> 5) Overlay the J+D department logo in an appealing way over any image of your choice (keep this separate from the other submissions, even if you use one of the same images). j+d logo.svg</li>
            
            <li> 6) Make a crazy creative image from one or more of your photos, using any tools you like in Photoshop</li>
        </ul>


            Save all images as high quality jpgs at 150dpi. Except for the banner, for all images, your smallest side should be a minimum of 600px and your longest side should be a maximum of 1200px (any size in between these is ok). 
            
            Put your new images in a folder called "edits" and your original (unretouched, uncropped) images in a folder called "originals". Put both of these images in a folder named lastname-firstname and upload it the folder called "Photoshop Edits" in our shared Google Drive.  Submit a link to this master folder on the assignment in Canvas.
